# schelling3d
PyTorch implementation of Schelling's segregation model in 2D and 3D

# Ideas
- von Neumann neighborhood of 4 individuals
- Moore neighborhood of eight individuals
- Concentration of one population for binary case
- Kernel size
- Add empty space to both 2D and 3D cases
For example, both list l+(t) and lâˆ’(t) are ordered from most to less unhappy individuals, and then we take randomly among the most unhappy individuals one element of each list and exchange them.


1. Add support fo empty space in 2D grid
2. Add support for different concentration of particles for N classes
